<h1 align="center"> <u> MY COUNTRY </u> </h1>

<h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>
<p> I love my country, not because it is my motherland. The people around me are lovely. The tradition is something unique. My mother tongue is the most beautiful language of the earth. The natural beauty spread all over India is really enchanting. The religious touch that we could find among Indians is heart-touching. Besides all this factors, there are many other aspects of India which have attracted my attention to keep me loving it.
</p>

<h2> UNITY IN DIVERSITY </h2>
<p> We speak different languages. Every 25kms entertains a different culture. All the major religions are followed here. Political parties are diverse at the national as well as regional level. In spite of all these differences, we become ONE when matters of national concerns arise. The warmth and hospitality of the Indians is quite visible due to the diversity. The economic renaissance is amazing in the recent past. The economic progress of the people has maintained the unity of the people. The Indian philosophy of Humanism has sustained the unity amidst the diversity.

<h2 align="center"> Creativity of the People </h2>
<p> To quote Sri Aurobindo, "For more than 3000 years, India has been creating abundantly and incessantly, lavishly with inexhaustible multitudes, republics, kingdoms, empires, philosophies, cosmogonies, sciences, creeds, arts, poems, historical monuments, palaces, temples, public works, communities, societies, religious orders, laws, codes and rituals, physical sciences, psychic sciences, systems of Yoga and yogis, systems of politics, administration, spiritual arts, worldly arts, trades, industries, fine crafts - and the list runs endlessly." This is the honest word to vouch for describing the creativity of my nation.

<p> <i> India is a country of many diversities. From its food to the attires, innovations to creations, books to arts, palaces to monastries, religious places to tourist attractions. Everything has a flavour of its grandeur and richness of taste and cultural inheritage. That's the beauty of this nation.
